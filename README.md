# Youtube_FCUK
A YouTube video downloader written in Python using BeautifulSoup and the requests library...

# Usage

Clone this repository into your destination folder:

                               git clone https://github.com/ppvalluri09/Youtube_FCUK/
                               cd "Directory Name"
                               
Now the Python script takes in a few command line arguments:-

  1. First one is obviously the file_name, so let's not get into it
  2. The youtube video URL
  3. Mode, whether it's a Single Video or a Playlist (The Playlist mode is still under development). 
     Type in 1 for Video and 2 for Playlist
  4. Folder name, the video(s) will be downloaded into a folder, so the name of the folder also needs to be provided.

Example:-

                         python 'https://youtube.com/watch?v={some video_id}' 1 'folder_name'
                         
Note:- The Script was written in Python3 so if you have both installed on your PC/Laptop be sure to mention that in the command.
